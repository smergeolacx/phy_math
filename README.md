# phy_math
Writing pyhics and math simulaions and testing out codes and expirmenting.

Always been fasinated with physics math and coding and always wanted to comebine them and so some simulations.
There are alternatives but what is more fun than coding it yourself.

Wanna start simple and branch out to more complex stuff and different languages.
Trying out in python with the pygame module right now for the whole graphical part of it. will slowly shift towaards cpp i suppose and trying to implement an own graphical interface. getting ahead of ourselves.
 
CHEERS!!!
